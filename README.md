# Habitrax

*A terminal-based personal development tracker combining habit building, productivity, and introspection into one unified system.*

## What is Habitrax?

Habitrax is a CLI app designed to help you:

- Track your tasks, productivity, and self-discipline  
- Reflect daily with randomized deep questions  
- Monitor progress using gamified stats and solo leveling  
- Build powerful habits using philosophies from:  
  - Deep Work  
  - Atomic Habits  
  - Slight Edge  
  - Think & Grow Rich  
  - Shadow Work Journal  

> You don't just live life — you *level through it*.

---

## Philosophy

Most productivity apps force structure on you.  
Habitrax does the opposite — it's a *sandbox for your goals, actions, and reflections.*

- Every decision is a vote toward your future self  
- Every session is data, analyzed and visualized for self-awareness  
- You define your purpose, rules, and trajectory  

---

## Core Modules

- *Session Logging* – Track tasks, time, focus, and productivity quality  
- *Debrief* – Daily introspection with randomized deep questions
- *Soul Work* – Gratitude, philosophy, and "Slight Edge" voting  
- *Status Window* – Gamified stats like cognition, intelligence, and missions  
- *Notebook* – Store insights, mantras, or journal entries  
- *Statistics* – Filter and visualize productivity trends  
- *Missions* – Self-defined goals with tracked completion  
- *Coffer* – Manually track your finances  
- *Almanack* – Define your chief aim and personal commandments

## Data & Privacy

- All user data is stored *locally* in JSON files  
- You can back up or migrate manually  
- Future versions may support encryption or SQLite  

---

## Limitations

- Not beginner-friendly (no undo or in-app editing — by design)  
- Requires basic terminal use (`ls`, `cd`, `python run.py`)  
- Built for personal use — but shared for others who resonate  
- Currently no automated tests (manual testing only)
